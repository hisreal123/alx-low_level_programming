# 0x13-more_singly_linked_lists

This directory contains C source code and header files that demonstrate the use of singly linked lists in C. The files in this directory are part of the "0x13. C - More singly linked lists" project for the Holberton School curriculum. They serve as examples of how to manipulate singly linked lists in C.

## Files

- `0-print_listint.c`: C source code that prints all elements of a linked list of integers, one element per line.
- `1-listint_len.c`: C source code that returns the number of elements in a linked list of integers.
- `2-add_nodeint.c`: C source code that adds a new node at the beginning of a linked list of integers.
- `3-add_nodeint_end.c`: C source code that adds a new node at the end of a linked list of integers.
- `4-free_listint.c`: C source code that frees a linked list of integers.
- `5-free_listint2.c`: C source code that frees a linked list of integers and sets the head to `NULL`.
- `6-pop_listint.c`: C source code that deletes the head node of a linked list of integers and returns its data.
- `7-get_nodeint.c`: C source code that returns the nth node of a linked list of integers.
- `8-sum_listint.c`: C source code that returns the sum of all the data (integers) in a linked list of integers.
- `9-insert_nodeint.c`: C source code that inserts a new node at a given position in a linked list of integers.
- `10-delete_nodeint.c`: C source code that deletes a node at a given position in a linked list of integers.
